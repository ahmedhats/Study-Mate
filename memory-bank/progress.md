## What Works

### Backend Components:

- ✅ Socket.IO server setup in Backend/server.js
- ✅ Socket.IO authentication middleware
- ✅ Backend/socket.handler.js for WebSocket event handling
- ✅ Conversation model with proper schema and indexes
- ✅ Message model with proper schema and indexes
- ✅ conversation.service.js with core conversation management functions
- ✅ message.service.js with message CRUD operations
- ✅ REST API routes for conversation/message operations

### Frontend Components:

- ✅ socket.io-client integration in websocketService.js
- ✅ Basic API services for conversations and messages
- ✅ ChatContainer component (reusable UI for all chat types)
- ✅ ConversationList component (shows available conversations)
- ✅ MessagingPage component (combines list and chat UI)
- [~] Create and implement `MessagingContext.js` for frontend state management, socket event handling, and coordinating messaging actions. (Initial structure created, needs integration and testing)

### Core Features:

- ✅ User authentication for Socket.IO connections
- ✅ Real-time message sending and receiving
- ✅ Conversation creation and retrieval
- ✅ Message history persistence and retrieval
- ✅ Direct messaging between users
- ✅ Basic typing indicators
- ✅ Unread message tracking via lastReadTimestamp
- ✅ Support for different conversation types (DM, COMMUNITY, STUDY_SESSION)

## What's Left To Build

### Backend:

- ⬜ Integration with study session lifecycle events
- ⬜ Integration with community events
- ⬜ System notification message generation
- ⬜ Comprehensive error handling for edge cases
- ⬜ Unit and integration tests

### Frontend:

- ⬜ Integration with application router
- ⬜ UI for creating new DM conversations from user profiles
- ⬜ Enhanced presence indicators in UI
- ⬜ In-app notifications for new messages
- ⬜ Mobile responsiveness improvements
- ⬜ Message grouping by sender/time
- ⬜ Read receipts UI

### Remaining Tasks from SOW:

1. **Integration with Existing Platform**:

   - ⬜ Add MessagingPage to main router
   - ⬜ Connect with user profile pages for starting DMs
   - ⬜ Connect community UI with messaging system
   - ⬜ Connect study session UI with messaging system

2. **Advanced Features**:

   - ⬜ Complete typing indicators implementation
   - ⬜ Implement read receipts
   - ⬜ Add system notifications
   - ⬜ Enhance presence/online status display

3. **Testing and Refinement**:
   - ⬜ Comprehensive testing of messaging flows
   - ⬜ Edge case handling
   - ⬜ Performance optimization
   - ⬜ UX refinements

## Current Status

**Phase 2-3 Transition**: The project has completed most of Phase 1 and Phase 2 tasks from the SOW and is now transitioning to Phase 3 (Community Chat Integration) and starting some Phase 4 tasks (Study Session Chat).

**Active Development Areas**:

- Integration of messaging with existing community features
- Implementation of the MessagingPage in the application router
- Enhancement of the ConversationList with filtering and organization
- Refinement of the user interface for improved usability

## Known Issues

1. **WebSocket Authentication**:

   - Issue: In some edge cases, token refresh might not properly update the Socket.IO connection
   - Status: Under investigation
   - Priority: Medium

2. **Message Synchronization**:

   - Issue: Messages sent via WebSocket may not always match exactly with API-fetched messages
   - Status: Identified, solution planned
   - Priority: High

3. **Typing Indicators**:

   - Issue: Typing indicators sometimes persist after a user stops typing
   - Status: Being addressed with timeout mechanism
   - Priority: Low

4. **Study Session Message Cleanup**:

   - Issue: Need to ensure proper deletion of messages when study sessions end
   - Status: Functionality implemented but needs more testing
   - Priority: Medium

5. **UI Consistency**:
   - Issue: Some styling inconsistencies between new messaging components and existing UI
   - Status: Being addressed incrementally
   - Priority: Medium

## Next Milestones

1. **Complete Router Integration** (Target: 1-2 days)

   - Add MessagingPage to application router
   - Implement navigation between user profiles and DM creation

2. **Community Chat Integration** (Target: 3-5 days)

   - Update existing community components to use new message system
   - Ensure backward compatibility

3. **Study Session Chat Implementation** (Target: 3-4 days)

   - Create dedicated study session chat view
   - Implement message lifecycle tied to session events

4. **Testing & Refinement Phase** (Target: 5-7 days)
   - Comprehensive testing across features
   - Performance optimization
   - UI/UX refinements
