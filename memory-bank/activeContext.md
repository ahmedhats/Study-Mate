# StudyMate Active Context

## Current Development Focus

The team is currently implementing the **Messaging Feature** as outlined in the Statement of Work (SOW.md). This is a critical component that enables real-time communication across the platform through:

1. Direct Messages (DMs) between users
2. Community chat rooms
3. Temporary study session chats

The work has progressed through several phases of the implementation plan:

- âœ… Backend foundation with Socket.IO
- âœ… Core MongoDB models (Conversation and Message)
- âœ… Backend services for conversations and messages
- âœ… API endpoints for messaging
- âœ… Frontend Socket.IO client integration
- âœ… Basic UI components for messaging
- ðŸ”„ Integration with existing platform features (in progress)
- â¬œ Testing and polishing
- â¬œ Deployment

## Recent Changes

1. **Backend Changes**:

   - Migrated from native WebSockets (`ws`) to Socket.IO
   - Created Conversation and Message Mongoose models
   - Implemented conversation and message services
   - Added REST API endpoints for message operations
   - Set up Socket.IO handlers for real-time messaging

2. **Frontend Changes**:
   - Updated WebSocket service to use socket.io-client
   - Created UI components for messaging:
     - ConversationList: Shows all user conversations
     - ChatContainer: Handles message display and sending
     - MessagingPage: Combines list and chat views
   - Added conversation service for API calls

## Next Steps

The immediate next tasks in the implementation plan are:

1. **Crucial Frontend Foundation**:

   - [x] Create and implement `MessagingContext.js`. (Initial structure created at `src/context/MessagingContext.js`. This context is essential for managing messaging state, handling WebSocket events, and providing actions to UI components. Next step is to integrate it with `App.jsx` and UI components like `ConversationList.jsx`.)

2. **Integration**:

   - Add MessagingPage to main application router
   - Connect messaging with user profile navigation
   - Enhance notification system for new messages
   - Complete integration with study sessions
   - Complete integration with community features

3. **Enhancement**:

   - Implement typing indicators (partially done)
   - Add read receipts
   - Enhance presence indicators
   - Add support for system notifications

4 **Testing**:

- Unit tests for backend services
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end testing of messaging flow
- Load testing with simulated users

## Active Decisions & Considerations

1. **Study Session Message Persistence**:

   - Decision: Study session messages will be deleted when the session ends
   - Rationale: Encourages open communication during sessions without creating permanent records
   - Implementation: Session end triggers message deletion through the message service

2. **Real-time Updates vs. API Calls**:

   - Decision: Hybrid approach - WebSockets for immediate updates, REST API for history and persistence
   - Consideration: Ensures both real-time experience and data integrity
   - Implementation: Messages sent via both channels (Socket.IO and HTTP)

3. **User Presence Handling**:

   - Decision: Use Socket.IO connection state as primary indicator, with supplementary last active time
   - Consideration: Balances accuracy with performance
   - Implementation: Broadcast relevant presence updates to interested clients

4. **Conversation Participant Management**:

   - Decision: Participants stored directly in conversation documents with metadata
   - Consideration: Enables efficient queries and last read tracking
   - Implementation: Participants array with userId, joinedAt, and lastReadTimestamp

5. **Message Content Structure**:
   - Decision: Content object with type and text fields
   - Consideration: Allows future expansion to different message types (e.g., images)
   - Current scope: TEXT and SYSTEM_NOTIFICATION types only for MVP

## Current Challenges

1. **Notification Integration**:

   - Need to determine best approach for in-app notifications for new messages
   - Considering whether to use existing notification system or create messaging-specific solution

2. **Study Session Lifecycle**:

   - Need to ensure study session chats are properly created when sessions start
   - Need to confirm chat deletion workflow when sessions end

3. **Community Chat Integration**:

   - Need to modify existing community components to use new messaging system
   - Must ensure backward compatibility with existing community data

4. **UI/UX Refinement**:
   - Mobile responsiveness needs improvement
   - Need to ensure consistent styling with existing components
   - Message grouping by time/sender may enhance readability

## Recent API Changes

New API endpoints have been added to support messaging:

- `GET /api/conversations` - Get user's conversations
- `GET /api/conversations/:conversationId/messages` - Get messages for a conversation
- `POST /api/conversations/:conversationId/messages` - Send a message
- `GET /api/conversations/dm/:userId` - Get or create a DM conversation
- `POST /api/conversations/:conversationId/read` - Mark conversation as read
- `POST /api/conversations/study-session/:sessionId` - Create a study session conversation
- `DELETE /api/conversations/study-session/:sessionId` - Deactivate a study session conversation
