# User Session Improvements

## Overview

Enhanced the study session system to properly handle user-created sessions with correct names and data persistence while keeping the existing mock sessions.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Session Data Storage

- **Multiple Storage Methods**: Sessions are now stored in both individual localStorage entries and a collective list for redundancy
- **Data Persistence**: All user-provided session data (title, description, subject, etc.) is properly preserved
- **User Attribution**: Sessions now correctly attribute to the actual user name from localStorage

### 2. Improved Session Retrieval

- **Priority-based Retrieval**: The `getStudySessionDetails` function now uses a 4-tier approach:
  1. Individual session storage (fastest)
  2. Collective mock sessions list
  3. Legacy storage format (backward compatibility)
  4. Minimal session generation (last resort)

### 3. Better User Name Handling

- **Real User Names**: Sessions now use actual user names from localStorage instead of generic placeholders
- **Jitsi Integration**: Display names in video calls now reflect real user information
- **Fallback System**: Graceful fallbacks for cases where user data isn't available

### 4. Enhanced Session Creation

- **Complete Data Preservation**: All form fields are properly saved and retrieved
- **Session Type Support**: Both individual and group sessions are properly distinguished
- **Timestamp Integration**: Session IDs include creation timestamps for better organization

### 5. Improved Clean-up

- **Dual Storage Cleanup**: Session deletion now removes data from both storage locations
- **Memory Management**: Better handling of storage to prevent data leaks

## Files Modified

### `src/services/api/studySessionService.js`

- Added `storeSessionData()` and `getSessionData()` helper functions
- Enhanced `createStudySession()` to preserve all user data
- Improved `getStudySessionDetails()` with 4-tier retrieval system
- Updated `deleteStudySession()` for complete cleanup

### `src/components/features/studySessions/JitsiVideoRoom.jsx`

- Enhanced `getDisplayName()` to use real user names from localStorage
- Better handling of user identity in video calls

### `src/components/features/studySessions/DirectVideoTest.jsx`

- Added comprehensive test functionality
- Session creation and retrieval testing
- User data verification system

## How It Works

### Session Creation Flow

1. User creates session with custom title, description, subject, etc.
2. System generates unique session ID with timestamp
3. Session data is stored in multiple locations for reliability
4. User's actual name is extracted from localStorage and associated with session

### Session Retrieval Flow

1. Check individual session storage first (fastest access)
2. Fall back to collective sessions list
3. Check legacy storage format for backward compatibility
4. Generate minimal session data as last resort

### User Experience

- **Preserved Names**: User-created sessions maintain their actual titles and descriptions
- **Real Identity**: Video calls show real user names instead of generic placeholders
- **Reliable Access**: Multiple storage methods ensure sessions can always be retrieved
- **Mock Compatibility**: Existing mock sessions continue to work alongside user sessions

## Testing

### Access Test Interface

Visit `/video-test` to access the test interface which includes:

- Basic Jitsi URL testing
- User session creation testing
- Data persistence verification
- Session joining functionality

### Verification Steps

1. Create a session with custom data
2. Verify the session data is properly stored
3. Join the session and confirm video integration works
4. Check that user names appear correctly in Jitsi

## Benefits

- **Better UX**: Users see their actual session names and details
- **Data Integrity**: Session information is properly preserved and retrievable
- **Scalability**: System handles both mock and real sessions seamlessly
- **Reliability**: Multiple storage methods ensure data availability
- **Future-Proof**: Enhanced system supports API integration when backend becomes available
